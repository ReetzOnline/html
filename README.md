Returning soon. I set this up on using postfix, dovecot and roundcude on an apache2 server. User details were retrieved from my mariaDB database and spam training worked well using rspand and redis. My machine stalled after installing clamav, the first indication a larger machine was needed. And on testing through dkimvalidator.com, my headers, dkim signature, spf and dmarc records all came through successfully. After a test email to my personal outlook account, my server was immediately added to the Spamhause blacklist. I plan to obtain a static IP address and larger capacity machine before returning to tinker with my email server.
